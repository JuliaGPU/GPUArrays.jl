The following keyword arguments are supported:\n\ntarget::AbstractArray: specify which array object to use for determining execution properties (defaults to the first argument arg0).\nelements::Int: how many elements will be processed by this kernel. In most circumstances, this will correspond to the total number of threads that needs to be launched, unless the kernel supports a variable number of elements to process per iteration. Defaults to the length of arg0 if no other keyword arguments that influence the launch configuration are specified.\nthreads::Int and blocks::Int: configure exactly how many threads and blocks are launched. This cannot be used in combination with the elements argument.\nname::String: inform the back end about the name of the kernel to be executed.
